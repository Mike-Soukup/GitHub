Netflix is a subscriber-based driven business model. It does not rely on ratings to sell advertising space like most TV giants. 

Key Netflix Metric = Valued hours how Netflix tries to measure the contribution of a TV show or movie makes to Netflix's ability to sign up and retain customers. A variation on viewing hours. A proprietary account of total number of hours spent watching content and the percentage of someone's total viewing a particular show or movie. If someone watches a show too long, those hours are worth less to a streaming firm. 

Q2 - 6.8 million new subscribers globally 

Netflix also tries to measure "enjoyment" - how much someone liked the show. This is also proprietary. 

Business Challenge Being Addressed?

- In January 2007, JP Morgan Securities downgraded Netflix citing high competition and most wondered how Netflix might create a 'second act' beyond DVD distribution. Netflix's original success was in logistics and distribution.

- Netflix developed its recommendation engine, Cinematch, to better predict the pattern of request of DVD titles by subscribers. It was always a data analytics company at its heart.

- By 2009, Netflix had over 100,000 DVD titles and 10 million customers. 
	- The company decided to innovate with a focus of logistics and analytics. 
	- The two big drivers were actually (1) Technology and (2) Data & Analytics

- Started its streaming services in 2007. Went from Netflix 1.0 (DVD-by-Mail company) to Netflix 2.0 (Streaming services/Video on demand)

How was the project and its outcome communicated to a wider audience?

Did the project get put into wider production or initiate other projects?
- Started in the USA but is now international, Netflix is available in over 190 Countries with 57% coming from outside the US. - 2016 Netflix was officially available worldwide 
- Encouraged other video on demand services like Disney+, Hulu, Amazon, Apple, etc. 
- Has led to the production of their own original content. Which won and Oscar for "The White Helmets"
