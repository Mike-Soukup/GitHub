In your own words, explain what a derivative is. How have derivatives played a role in your life, either professionally or personally? If you are having trouble with this, check out the examples throughout Chapter 11 for inspiration or search for an article that discusses an application of the derivative.

	A derivative is an instantaneous rate of change. My favorite way to conceptualize what a derivative is comes from thinking about driving. When I drive, I constantly monitor my speed. The speed I am going is an instantaneous rate of change! It is a derivative. The speedometer is not repeatedly updating my average rate of change from my current position to my start position. No, it is telling me how fast I am going at that moment in miles per hour. The speedometer is a derivative of the position function of my car traveling over time. 

	One way derivatives have played a role in all of our lives comes into play when we think about climate change. Evidence of climate change comes from monitoring the amount of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere over time. Graphing this we can see that since the industrial revolution, the rate at which we have been expelling carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is unprecedented.
