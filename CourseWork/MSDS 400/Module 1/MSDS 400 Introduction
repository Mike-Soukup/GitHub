MSDS 400 Introduction

Hello, Class! My name is Mike Soukup and I am currently a Manufacturing Technology Engineer for Aerospace Adhesive Films and Primers at 3M. I am currently living in the Twin Cities area (Minneapolis/St. Paul, MN) but travel a good amount of time for work as well. My job responsibilities entail scaling up new products, facilitating management of change actions, incorporating destructive technologies into our manufacturing processes, and analyzing copious amounts of production data to identify opportunities for improvement. 

I am a relatively recent grad from University of Wisconsin - Madison. I graduated with a degree in Chemical Engineering and as such have taken math through Calc III, liner algebra and differential equations, and some applied courses like transport phenomena. I am hoping this class will be a nice refresher for some concepts I haven't spent much time thinking about in the last couple of years. More so, I am excited about the heavy focus on incorporating these topics with Python. I completed MSDS 430 in the summer and am eager to continue to develop my Python skills!

I plan on specializing in Artificial Intelligence in the MSDS program. I see this degree as a way to develop a highly specialized tool set that I plan on using to implement more predictive and prescriptive analytic solutions to areas that interest me. For instance, improved preventative maintenance schedules for manufacturing equipment or non-intuitive product realization opportunities for Aerospace customers. 

When I am not working or studying, I enjoy reading, running, cooking, watching sports, and spending time with my family in no particular order. I am looking forward to working and getting to know each of you!
