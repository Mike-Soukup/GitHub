I have a major sweet tooth and love for ice cream. But not just ice cream! I am talking custard, frozen yogurt, gelato, all things frozen and delicious. This week I wanted to flush out one of my day dreams and realize how to run a profitable ice cream truck (think food truck instead of ice cream man).

I have three staple frozen treat recipes. One for frozen custard, old style ice cream, and frozen yogurt. To make a batch of each frozen treat, the resources below are required and outputted:

Custard:
Volume (gal) = 3 
Eggs = 24
Sugar (cups) = 8
Cost = $75

Ice Cream:
Volume (gal) = 1
Eggs = 8
Sugar (cups) = 2
Cost = $50

Frozen Yogurt:
Volume (gal) = 3 
Eggs = 0
Sugar (cups) = 4
Cost = $30

I know I can fit a 100 gallon freezer in my ice cream truck. I also have 300 eggs and 200 cups of sugar. Additionally, I have a $1,000 left in my budget to make batches of my treats to make the biggest profit possible. If I make $225, $175, and $100 respectively for each batch of custard, ice cream, and frozen yogurt, how many batches of each frozen treat should I make to generate the largest profit?
